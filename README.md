# 🏢 Gurugram Real Estate Business Intelligence

**A Structured Client-Oriented Analytics Framework**
*Confidential — Internal Consulting Simulation Project*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a **full-scale Business Intelligence consulting simulation** built on:

* **Dataset:** 105,000+ Gurugram Property Transactions
* **Time Period:** 2021–2026
* **Total Questions Solved:** 60

  * Easy: 15
  * Medium: 20
  * Hard: 25

This project replicates how a **Senior Real Estate Brokerage Leadership Team** would engage a data consultant to drive revenue growth, optimise operations, and make strategic portfolio decisions.

The objective is not just to answer questions — but to **translate data into executive-level business decisions.**
